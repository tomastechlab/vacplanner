# Vacation Planner

This is a tool that I build for my friends. 
Every year we plan a vacation with about 20 people. So far everything was organized in Excel sheets and scattered around in random chatgroups. 
I try to create an application that can be used to do all the things that are needed to plan our trips.
That includes (but is not limited to):
- where do we want to go
- creating a list of who is coming
- what needs to be packed
- who brings what
- comment on certain topics
- ...

to accomplish this I created various components that can be used by itself e.g. lists but they can also be linked to everything else like other lists, people, votings.. and so on.

After the trip is done this tool should also be able to handle image and video uploads to create gallery for specific trips. This way we also have a way of saving all those memories in a single place where everybody can find them.
